## What are retrievers;

-> A retriever is a component in langchain that fetches relevant documents from a data source in a response to use's query.

-> There are multiple types of retrievers

-> all retrievers in langchain are runnables


## (data source/could be vector store or apis/main thing data are stored there) , now query will come to retriever now retriever will go to data source and take all to relavent documents ; and when those docments are gotten then it will be fetched by retriever

## you can think it as --> query --> (retriever /kind of fn /like a search engine) --> relavent document objects from datasource
