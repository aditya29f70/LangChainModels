## Text splitting
-> Text splitting is the process of breaking large chunks of text (like articles, pdfs, HTML pages, or books) into smaller, manageable pleces (chunks) that an llm can handle effectively.


(Large Text) ---> (Chunks) 

## that operator which does these kinds of works is call **text spliiter**

* llm output quality will increase if you give these chunks instead give the whole text file

## reason behind using text splitter

* Overcomig model limitations: Many embedding models and language models have maximum input size constraints. splitting allows us to process documents that would otherwise exceed these limits.

* Downstream tasks - Text Splitting improve nearly every LLM powered task

Task          | why splitting Helps
1. Embedding  | Short Chunks yield more accurate vectors
2. Semantic Search | Search results point to focused info, not noise
3. Summarization   | prevents hallucination and topic drift (sometime it will start to give unrelated things which will not happens if you use text-splitting)

* Optimizing computational resources : working with smaller chunks of text can be more memory-efficient allow for better parallelization of processing task.

## we will be studing four diff kind of text splitters in langchian
1. length based
2. Text structure based
3. Document Structure based
4. Semantic Meaning Based
