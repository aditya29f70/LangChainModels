## Text splitting
-> Text splitting is the process of breaking large chunks of text (like articles, pdfs, HTML pages, or books) into smaller, manageable pleces (chunks) that an llm can handle effectively.


(Large Text) ---> (Chunks) 

## that operator which does these kinds of works is call **text spliiter**

* llm output quality will increase if you give these chunks instead give the whole text file

## reason behind using text splitter

* Overcomig model limitations: Many embedding models and language models have maximum input size constraints. splitting allows us to process documents that would otherwise exceed these limits.

* Downstream tasks - Text Splitting improve nearly every LLM powered task

Task          | why splitting Helps
1. Embedding  | Short Chunks yield more accurate vectors
2. Semantic Search | Search results point to focused info, not noise
3. Summarization   | prevents hallucination and topic drift (sometime it will start to give unrelated things which will not happens if you use text-splitting)

* Optimizing computational resources : working with smaller chunks of text can be more memory-efficient allow for better parallelization of processing task.

## we will be studing four diff kind of text splitters in langchian
1. length based
2. Text structure based
3. Document Structure based
4. Semantic Meaning Based

## 1. length based 
here size of the chunk is decided (you can decide it according to it's number of charactors or number tokens it's up to you)

## dis-advantage of this splitter
--> it don't see linguestic structure of your text before splitting nor grammar and sementic meaning 

* how to use it in langchain --> we have a direct class Charactor_text_splitter

* params
1. chunk_size
2. chunk_overlap --> what it means;; it identify how many char will be overlap bw two chunks

* now question what is benifit that we will be getting you we use chunk_overlap by that some context meaning of sentence mainten , if a chunk start showing overlap char with it next chunk what would be great to main context meaning;; this is assumation that 10-20% chunk overlap would be good if you want to main chunk context meaning mainten for min 100 chunk size
3. separator=""
