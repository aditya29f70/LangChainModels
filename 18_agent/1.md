## Ai agent

- Goal driven : -> You tell the agent what you want not how to do it.

- Autonomous planning : -> Agent breaks down the problem and sequences tasks on its own

- Tool-using : -> Agent call APIs, calculators, search tools, etc

- Context aware : -> Maintains memory across steps to inform future actions

- Adaptive : -> Rethinks plan when things change (eg. Api fail, no data)
