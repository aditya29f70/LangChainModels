Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the 

centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails 

(small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in 

front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the
striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat

and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps.
Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.

The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Dismissal can occur in 

various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by

the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting 

a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket.
