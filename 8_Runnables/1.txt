behind the seen chains work bz they are made through runnables , you should know what runnable work 
for chains

## first try to understand --> why it exsist
so for understanding we will make two type of application

lanchain didn't limited there self, it's also provide such functionality so you can load the text, spliting, embedding
vector_database

1. simple (user(take topic) -> prompt -> llm(ask that query))
for making work easier langchain build a chain --> LLMChain where only need to give (prompt, llm)
2. pdf reader
for making work easier lanchain build a chain according to it's most common step so we don't need to go manually
chain --> RetrieverQAChain only need to give (llm, retriever)



they are making the chains but there is a problem 
--> over time langchain has made lot of chains
problem they are not made to connect them in the future they are made such like work independently(they have diff funcationally to invoke and do other thing are very diff calling fn)
--> so runnable in the screen now it make these functionality(llm, splitter, loader, parser, retrieval etc) standardise 
 so anyone can connect then very easly



 ###### now try to understand what is runnable
 -> ''unit of work'' --> each runnable has to do a work
 -> you can give a input to that runnable --> runnable process that input --> gives output 

# each runnable face a common interface (you will get same set of methods in each runnable)
eg ''invoke()'' , batch(), stream()

--> you can connect these runnable and you can make any complex workflow with using it
--> and note;; when you make a workflow with the help of runnable it itself a runnable


##### how --> code
