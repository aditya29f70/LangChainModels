# code implementation of RAG

## Lets talk about problem statement;;

--> **Youtube Chat** --> this will be a kind of video query system where you can ask any question about a youtube video

## final result can be shown as 1. chrome plug-in (user have to first install it) now video will be going and chat will open after clicking on it 2. make a stremlit website where you will give youtube video link after when you click ok in another tab a chat will start where you can chat about that video

## workflow (similar like rag pipeline)

- (YouTube video) -->1. load it's transcript useing (Youtbe transcript loader(ytloader))(buggy in some cases) or youtube also has some apis by hitting those you can get any youtube video transcript (we will use api) --> by using text-splitter we will divide that video transcript into diff chunks --> now generate embedding of those chunks --> now store those chunks(text) and their vector in the vector database (now the whole indexing work is done(step1 of RAG pipeline)) --> create a retriever (for now use simple similarity base retriever) and send our query to retriever now retriever will embedding that query and go to semantic search with vector store and will retrieve relavant chunks or docs from vector store --> called **context** (step 2 Retriever in Rag pipeline) --> building prompt useing **context** + query (step3 Augmentation of rag pipeline) --> now send that prompt to llm (called step4 generation) --> response
