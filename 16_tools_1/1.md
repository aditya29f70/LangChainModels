# Now try to understand how agents build

## topic which we will study

(tools) --> (tools calling)(basically connect your tool which you have made with LLM) --> (Agents)

## What is a tools?

-> A tool is just a python fn (or api) that is packaged in a way the LLM can understand and call when needed.

- LLMs (like GPT) are great at : 1. Reasoning (llm can think), 2. Language generation (also has speaking capability);; that its there is not any other power it has

- it can have capability to do any task

- But they can't do things like:
- - Access live data (weather, news)
- - Do reliable math
- - Call APIs
- - Run code
- - Interact with a database

- now how can provide hands and legs to that llm (which had thinking and speaking power)
- you can provide any tool access which does any particular work
- so you can think it has a fn where you have written login inside it to do any work

## in langchain you get two kind of tools

1. Built-in Tools;;
   -> these are made on the basis of our regular search like we search things on gemini, wikipedia, google etc

2. Custom Tools;; if you want to build a tools which work for your own works

- How Tools fits into the Agent ecosystem
  -> An Ai agent is an LLM-powered system that can autonomously think, decide, and take actions using external tools or APIs to achieve a goal.

## (1) Now first try to understant how to work with **Build-in Tools**

-> A build-in tool is a tool that langchain already provides for you --it's pre-build, production-ready, and requires minimal or no setup.

-> You don't have to write the function logic yourself -- you just import and use it.;; see **pic_2**
eg; 1. PythonREPLTool (just tell for which concept you want python code it will return )

2. ShellTool ;; with help of this you can run shell commond
