we will descuss about 4 import output parsers

so what we need this bz we saw that we have two type of model in the basis of --> can we structure it's output ; so we seen that like openai model 
like we can easily structure there output put some other model we can't (mostly open source model) so here we basically learn how to fine tune these 
model so we can structure it's ouput --> that is call output parsing


Output Parsers --> in LangChain help convert raw LLM response into structure formats like json, csv,
pydantic models, and more. They ensure consistency, validation, and ease of use in applications.

basically it is written class in langchain which is used to getting the structure response from llm
(from any kind of llm model)

there are lot of output parsers but we mostly use 4 of them in this class
1. String output parser
2. json output parser
3. structured output parser
4. pydantic output parser


1. StrOutputParser
-> The StrOutputParser is the simplest output parser in LangChain. It is used to parse the output 
of a language model (LLM) and return it as a plain string

means it takes output from any llm convert it to string and then return as it is. 

why it is useful (in which senario); instead of using result.content why we only convert those whole thing in string
