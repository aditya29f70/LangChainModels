we will descuss about 4 import output parsers

so what we need this bz we saw that we have two type of model in the basis of --> can we structure it's output ; so we seen that like openai model 
like we can easily structure there output put some other model we can't (mostly open source model) so here we basically learn how to fine tune these 
model so we can structure it's ouput --> that is call output parsing


Output Parsers --> in LangChain help convert raw LLM response into structure formats like json, csv,
pydantic models, and more. They ensure consistency, validation, and ease of use in applications.

basically it is written class in langchain which is used to getting the structure response from llm
(from any kind of llm model)

there are lot of output parsers but we mostly use 4 of them in this class
1. String output parser
2. json output parser
3. structured output parser
4. pydantic output parser


1. StrOutputParser
-> The StrOutputParser is the simplest output parser in LangChain. It is used to parse the output 
of a language model (LLM) and return it as a plain string

means it takes output from any llm convert it to string and then return as it is. 

why it is useful (in which senario); instead of using result.content why we only convert those whole thing in string


Step-by-step process
sice here we need dynamic prompt so we'll use ''from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate''
1st write prompt --> detailed report 

2nd prompt --> summary 


## now try to use StrOutputParser --> how to use --> common uses -> main uses with ''chains''
(using chain we convert diff steps into a pipeline in langchain)

first create a parser using '' StrOutputParser()'';; basically we use parser which help use to extract main thing(content) from 
output of the llm
-> chain = template1 | model | parser | template | model | parser


########### now move to next output parser which ''json'' output parser
so its force llm to give it's output in json format ;; this the quiest possible way to get
get json output

now you have understood json out parser ; the main problem with that is -> you can tell llm to give
json output what you cann't enforce any schema (basically you can't say what would be the structure of your json output)
that llm will deside itself

# what if we want a structure like fact_1: , fact_2 .... (or in this kind of schema)
# so you can't do that through jsonOutputParser

that why we study structureOutputParser 

############## structureOuputParser 
--> is an output parser in langchain that helps extract structure json data from
llm response based on predefined field schemas.

it works by defining a list of field (response Schema) that the model should return, ensuring the 
output follows a structure format.

(basically here you can provide a schema so in the basis of that llm will give you the json response)
note::::::::::: you will get structureOuputParser in langchain.outputparser not in langchain_core
why bz most useable things are stored in langchain_core(a small ) bz are used a loat


# now try to know the desadvantage of that 
you can do ''' data validation throught that ''' you can only tell that what kind of structure output you want
(like typedDict)

## so this why we use the 4th one # pydanticOutputParser

################################### pydanticOutputParser

pydanticOutputParser is a structured output parser in Langchain that uses Pydantic models to enforce schema validation when processing LLM responses

why use pydanticOutputParser
-> Strict Schema enforcement -> ensures that LLM responses follow a well-defined structure.
-> type safety -> automatically convert LLM ouput into py object 
-> easy validation -> uses pydantic's build-in validation to catch incorrect or missing data. 
-> seamless integration -> works well with other langchain components


## basically in schema we take a pydantic obj so it will force for data validation things




so finally 
StrOutputParser --> when we use this we get string output from llm 
Json --> through that we get json output but schema is not defined
structure --> you can define schema but validation not possible
pydantic --> json output , can give schema, and also can validate


note there is lot of parser which you can see --> click crl+ left click --> all parser
